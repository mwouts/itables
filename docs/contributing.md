# Contributing

Thanks for considering making a contribution to ITables. There are
indeed many ways to help!

## Reporting an issue

If you see an issue, a possible improvement, or if you can't find
the answer to your question, then you are very welcome to create
an issue on this project. Please provide enough detail so that
we can reproduce the issue.

## Improving the documentation

If you would like to add a new example,
or improve the documentation, feel free to make a pull request!

You can render the documentation locally - see the section on
[Jupyter Book](developing.md#jupyter-book) in the developer guide.

## Developing a new feature

It is generally a good idea to get in touch with us first - e.g.
open an issue and let us know what you'd like to do.

But you can also simply clone the project and test your ideas.

A guide on how to set up a development environment, and how to
run some tests, is available [here](developing.md).
