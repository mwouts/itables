## DataTables

- DataTables is a plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library. It has a great [documentation](https://datatables.net/manual/), and a large set of [examples](https://datatables.net/examples/index).
- The R package [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) uses [datatables.net](https://datatables.net/) as the underlying library for both R notebooks and Shiny applications. In addition to the standard functionalities of the library (display, sort, filtering and row selection), RStudio seems to have implemented cell edition.

## Alternatives

ITables uses basic Javascript. It is not a Jupyter widget, which means that it does not allows you to **edit** the content of the dataframe.
