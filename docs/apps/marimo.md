# Marimo

```{warning}
The `init_notebook_mode` and the `show` function do not work in Marimo. This is because they both use `IPython.display` to display the HTML representation of the table, which is not a good fit for Marimo.
```

In Marimo the recommended way to use ITable is through the `ITable` [widget](widget.md):

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd

from itables.widget import ITable

df = pd.DataFrame({"x": [2, 1, 3]})

ITable(df)
```

A Sample Marimo application is available at [`apps/marimo/widget.py`](https://github.com/mwouts/itables/tree/main/apps/marimo/widget.py).


## Using HTML

You can also use `to_html_datatable` in combination with `mo.iframe` like in this example - but, as there is no `init_notebook_mode` cell, you will have to use the connected mode:

```python
import marimo as mo

from itables import to_html_datatable

html = to_html_datatable(df, connected=True)
mo.iframe(html)
```

A Sample Marimo application that uses `to_html_datatable` is available at [`apps/marimo/html.py`](https://github.com/mwouts/itables/tree/main/apps/marimo/html.py).
