0.4.6 (2022-03-??)
==================

Changed
-------
- We have removed the default column width at 70 pixels (#62)


0.4.5 (2022-01-25)
==================

Changed
-------
- The `itables` documentation now uses Jupyter Book (#56)
- We have added a new `style` option in `itables.options` and in `show`, with a default value equal to `max-width:100%`.


0.4.4 (2022-01-10)
==================

Fixed
-------
- Add 'require_config.js' to the pip package (#48)


0.4.3 (2022-01-08)
==================

Changed
-------
- When a JS function is created on the Python side, we export it as-is (without quotes) in the HTML file and don't use JS eval anymore.


0.4.2 (2022-01-07)
==================

Fixed
-----
- Fix the HTML output when `eval_functions=True`
- Display "Loading..." under the table header until the table is displayed with datatables.net
- `init_notebook_mode(all_interactive=False)` restores the original Pandas HTML representation.

0.4.1 (2022-01-06)
==================

Fixed
-------
- Long column names don't overlap anymore (#28)


0.4.0 (2022-01-06)
==================

Fixed
-------
- Now `itables` also works in Jupyter Lab, Colab, VS Code and PyCharm (#3, #4, #26, #40), as we load the `datatables.net` library with an ES import when `require.js` is not available. Many thanks to [FranÃ§ois Wouts](https://github.com/fwouts) for his precious help!

Changed
-------
- The `show` function (and `itables.options`) has a new argument `eval_functions`. When set to `True`, the nested strings passed to `datatables.net` that start with `function` are converted to Javascript functions.
- The HTML code for the datatables.net representation of the table is generated with an HTML template.
- We use f-strings and thus require Python >= 3.6


0.3.1 (2021-12-24)
==================

Fixed
-----
- We fixed an issue (`jquery` not found) with the HTML export when using `nbconvert>=6.0` (#21)
- We documented how to change the default ordering of rows - with the `order` option (#30)
- We documented how to load `require` in Jupyter Lab (#3)

Changed
-------
- The main branch for the project is `main` rather than `master`
- Updated `datatables` to 1.11.3 and `jquery` to 3.5.1


0.3.0 (2020-12-14)
==================

Fixed
-----
- `itables` now has an explicit `init_notebook_mode` function, which inserts the datatables.net library in the notebook. Use `init_notebook_mode(all_interactive=True)` to display all the pandas object as interactive tables. This fixes (#6) and (#17).

Changed
-------
- `itables` uses GitHub Actions for the CI.

Added
-----
- `itables` is tested with Python 3.9 as well.


0.2.2 (2020-10-01)
==================

Fixed
-----
- Pandas' `display.max_columns` can be `None`, by Arthur Deygin (#14)


0.2.1 (2019-11-21)
==================

Added
-----
- Animated screenshot in README

Fixed
-----
- Add IPython to setup.py install_requires, by Jon Shao (#9)


0.2.0 (2019-11-20)
==================

Added
-----
- Large tables are downsampled (#2)

Changed
-------
- Javascript code moved to Javascript files

Fixed
-----
- Tables with many columns are now well rendered (#5)


0.1.0 (2019-04-23)
==================
