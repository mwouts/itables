0.4.0 (2022-01-??)
==================

Changed
-------
- The `show` function (and `itables.options`) has a new argument `eval_functions`. When set to `True`, the nested strings passed to `datatables.net` that start with `function` are converted to Javascript functions.
- The HTML code for the datatables.net representation of the table is generated with an HTML template.


0.3.1 (2021-12-24)
==================

Fixed
-----
- We fixed an issue (`jquery` not found) with the HTML export when using `nbconvert>=6.0` (#21)
- We documented how to change the default ordering of rows - with the `order` option (#30)
- We documented how to load `require` in Jupyter Lab (#3)


Changed
-------
- The main branch for the project is `main` rather than `master`
- Updated `datatables` to 1.11.3 and `jquery` to 3.5.1


0.3.0 (2020-12-14)
==================

Fixed
-----
- `itables` now has an explicit `init_notebook_mode` function, which inserts the datatables.net library in the notebook. Use `init_notebook_mode(all_interactive=True)` to display all the pandas object as interactive tables. This fixes (#6) and (#17).

Changed
-------
- `itables` uses GitHub Actions for the CI.

Added
-----
- `itables` is tested with Python 3.9 as well.
